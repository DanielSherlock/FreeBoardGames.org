Issues:

Currently, when giving a Player a Hint that he/she doens't have a Color/Value, it is not visualized in any way.

The player should not be able to give hints, when there are no Hint tokens. How can I force this in the game logic?
My issue is, that I don't have access to G in the moveFunction. But I need to know to return INVALID_MOVE or not.

I would like the final score to be shown on the scoreboard, when the game ends.
